## ⚠️ macOS 14 ⚠️

since somewhere along the macOS 14 release Apple requires Alfred 5 to have the Bluetooth permissions enabled in order to connect and disconnect bluetooth devices. you can paste this: `open "x-apple.systempreferences:com.apple.preference.security?Privacy_Bluetooth"` in your terminal to access the UI and add Alfred manually.

## Connect / Disconnect

once your AirPods Pro(s) have been paired with your Mac just type `apc` to list them and connect or disconnect them at whim.
