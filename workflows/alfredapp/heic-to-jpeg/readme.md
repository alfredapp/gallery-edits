## Usage

Convert HEIC images to JPEG via the Universal Action.

![Universal Action for converting HEIC](images/ua.png)

Alternatively, find images with the `heicjpeg` keyword.

![Alfred search for HEIC images](images/heicjpeg.png)

JPEGs are saved to the `Save Folder` set in the Workflowâ€™s Configuration but you can immediately move them to another destination by choosing `Move to New Location` in the `After Conversion` configuration. Other options include showing a notification, revealing files in the Finder, and appending to the File Buffer.

The workflow will avoid overwriting any existing files, opting to stop rather than replace data.
