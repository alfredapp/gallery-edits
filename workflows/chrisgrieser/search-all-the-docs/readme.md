## Setup

Enable the [DevDocs](https://devdocs.io) you want to search in the Workflow’s Configuration.

## Usage

Search documentation via the workflow’s keywords, which follow the same name as the enabled devdocs. For example, `haskell foobar` searches the Haskell DevDocs for “foobar”. A few common languages have short-hands noted in the popup selection, such as `js` for JavaScript. In this case, you use `js foobar` to search instead.

### Additional Documentation Keywords
